       Many locations such as schools, shopping centers, and hospitals are incorporating recycling bins in their buildings. You may even have a recycling program in your neighborhood! Materials such as papers and some plastics can be recycled. It is important to check recyclable plastics for a recycling logo with a number in the middle. Some recycling programs may not accept certain numbers.

 This also means buying products that use recycled materials and containers that are recyclable. This will reduce the overall amount of waste produced, even if some items canâ€™t be recycled. Making sure that materials are recycled properly will also prevent mindless littering, as each product will have a certain bin.
