     <h3>Rate of Climate Change</h3>
     <p>
       Climate change is a common occurrence for the planet, but according to NASA, the rate at which the climate is changing is much different from the rates from the past 10,000 years. Since around the mid 1800s, human activities have affected the rate of climate change, causing it to increase. Especially since the industrial age, human activities have caused an increase in greenhouse gasses such as CO2, which harm the earth by trapping the sun’s energy. As a result, many parts of the earth have warmed, leading to changes in climate.

     <h3>Health Risks</h3>
     <p>
       There are also many health risks associated with climate change. According to the World Health Organization, the world’s increase in temperature will affect our food systems, our access to clean air and water, and the spread of disease. Some of these changes are inevitable even if we were to limit current emissions due to the impacts of past human activities. The groups of people who will be impacted most are those who contribute to the climate change crisis the least: those from disadvantaged countries. In order to limit the future changes, we must think long term and start acting now. Click on the links above to learn more about how you can help.
