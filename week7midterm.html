       <p>
         We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more at our
monthly sale. These are mostly from donations from individuals, estates, and companies. We
also sell items that the Palo Alto library has removed from their shelves to make room for new
purchases.
</p>
<p>
  Our Main Room is along the north driveway, adjacent to the Charleston Shopping Center
  (see map below). In this room, hardbound books start at $1 each and paperback books at 50
  cents each. Please bring your large book donations to this room too.

      <h3>What We're Selling</h3>
<p>
Children's books, music, videos, and toys are in our new room (near the Cubberley track,
Pavilion and the Greendell School), where you'll find many items for 50 cents or $1, including
picture books, school age fiction and nonfiction, non-English language books, CDs and DVDs,
and books for parents and teachers. On Saturday, during the first hour of the sale, please select
no more than 12 books at a time, and bring them to the cashiers to hold until you are ready to
pay for all your purchases.
</p>
<p>
  Bargain books are in rooms K6 and K7, where hardbound books are all $1, paperbacks are 50
cents each, and children's books are just 25 cents. On Sunday, prices in the bargain room are
half-off, plus you can save even more by purchasing grocery bags from us for $5 each and then
filling these with books. Please note that the Children's and Bargain rooms open one hour
earlier than the Main room on Saturday.
</p>
<p>
  You can purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations.

     <h3>How to Get a Spot in Line</h3>
     <p>
       Some customers come very early on Saturday to ensure an early place in line. We hand out a
       maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room, beginning at 8 am on the
       Saturday of the sale. If you receive a ticket, the number on it reserves your corresponding place
       in the line, allowing you to go off and get coffee or to visit the Children's and Bargain Book
       rooms. Please be sure to return to the Main Room a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your
       spot in the line: if you miss the time when your number is allowed to enter the Main Room you
       will forfeit your place in line. If you don’t arrive in time to get a ticket, please just join the latter
       part of the line
     </p>
     <p>
 Because of our severe space limitations and compelling issues of health and safety, we will only
allow 160 customers into the Main Room at a time. On Saturdays, customers will be originally
admitted in the order of their numbered tickets that are given out from 8 to 11 am. Once inside,
customers may take only 12 books off of shelves, after which they should purchase these and
exit via the east door. They may then join at the end of any remaining line at the north door and
reenter in that order. The limitation of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line
remains outside.
</p>
<p>
  You'll find these same low prices on all the other tens of thousands of books that we
have. While some booksellers may pledge a portion of your purchase to help local libraries, we
give 100%. Plus, we charge no sales tax and we have the friendliest sales people you’ll ever
find
