      Another important step in helping the planet is reducing the amount of fossil fuels we use. When fossil fuels are burned, they release CO2. There is also a limited amount of fossil fuels to burn. They are not sustainable sources of  energy. There is a push to use renewable sources of energy such as solar power from solar panels and wind power from wind turbines. Some homes are getting these forms of renewable energy installed.

       Something that we all can do to reduce the usage of fossil fuels is to drive less. Cars emit large amounts of CO2 and use up gasoline. By walking or biking, you can avoid using fossil fuels. Even by taking a bus or carpooling, you can reduce the amount of CO2 you produce. You can also reduce the use of fossil fuels by turning off lights and unplugging appliances that are not in use.
