  Hi! My name is Alexandra Morelli and I am an informatics major. In my free time I like to read and listen to music. My favorite color is purple and I have three sisters: one older and two younger.

   I hope to learn more about HTML and CSS in this class. I am also interested in learning more about the World Wide Web.
